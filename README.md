# Preview
this is a website for storing results from football games either from real football games or games such as FIFA.  
An instance of this website is currently running live at https://resultsnet.online

To see an example of a profile I have used personally see https://resultsnet.online/results/user/KTBM  
This example contains football seasons both from real life teams I have played in within Wellington as well as teams I have used in the video game FIFA. However this profile cannot be edited or changed unless you are logged in with the user KTBM.

However you can create an account and login or use a username of "testuser" and a password of "testuser" 
# What is ResultsNet
ResultsNet allows you to record football results in a structured manner. Such that the results are grouped by the competition, the competitions are grouped by the season and the seasons are grouped by the career (or collection if the makes more sense). The website will display one season at a time which will then display all the competitions and hence all the results that were contained within that season. [Here](https://resultsnet.online/results/user/KTBM/0e3330a8-71cf-4938-aca4-d525c79a4029/1dc9ac48-f990-4494-8105-92af01d75b8c) is an example of a currently ongoing season for team I play for this year (the team being Lower Hutt City AFC Fourplay). The design for the website is largely based on how professional football teams results are stored on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Chelsea_F.C._season#Competitions).
